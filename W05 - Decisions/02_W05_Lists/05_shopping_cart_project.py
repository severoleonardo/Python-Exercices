# For "Showing Creativity and Exceeding Requirements" I added an apply discount functionality.
# When the user chooses to apply a discount, the program checks if the cart is empty; 
# if so, it prints a message indicating that there are no items to apply a discount to
# Otherwise, it displays the items in the cart and asks the user to enter the number of the item to apply a discount to
# It then applies the discount to the selected item by updating the item_discounts list
# Prints a confirmation message indicating that the discount has been applied
# I've also added some formatting to improve the information that is shown to the user on the screen.

File: 05 Project: Shopping Cart
Author: Leonardo Severo

Purpose: create a program that stores a list of products in a shopping cart along with their prices.
"""

# Final Requirements
# 1 . Store prices as well as names.
# 2 . Change the add functionality to also ask for and store the price of the item.
# 2 . Change the display functionality to also display the prices of the items.
# 4 . When displaying the items, display a number in front of each item. The numbers should start with 1.
# 5 . Complete the option to display the total amount of the prices of all the items in the shopping cart.
# 6 . Whenever prices are displayed, they should be shown to two decimal places and include the appropriate currency symbol (for example $, â‚¬, etc.)
# 7 . Complete the option to remove an item from the shopping cart.
# 8 . When removing an item, you should verify the following:
# 8.1. Both the item name and price are removed from their respective lists.
# 8.2. The number the user enters should be converted to a 0-based index and checked to make sure it is within the bounds of the list.
# 8.3. The program allows you to remove any item from the list including the first one and the last one. (Sometimes, if you have a bug in your project you might not allow removing the last item as you should.)
